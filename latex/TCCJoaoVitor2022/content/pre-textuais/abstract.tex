This monograph has the objevtive to propose a method to automated test implementation in software projects, using as a case study an web application developed using the Laravel Framework and wich did not have automated tests. Using the procedures and test techniques found in the literature to identify tests, will be done the tests planning to identify the tests needed to verify the web application effectively, and then these tests will be automated using the PHPUnit and Laravel Dusk tools, provided by the Laravel Framework itself. Also will be build a continuous integration pipeline using Travis CI, in which the tests will be executed, then the execution results will be analysed. Based on these analisys, a set of best practices for automated tests implementation will be proposed.
